Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]


* Create a function called majority_elements().
* Initialize two elements element1, element2 and their respective counts count1, count2 to None and 0.
* Check if current number is a element if so increment its count .
* Check if one of the element's count reaches 0, replace it with the current number.
* Check if the current number is different from both element, decrement their counts.
* Verify the elements by counting thier occurrences.
* Check if the counts of the elements exceeds ⌊ n/3 ⌋ and add those candidates to the 'result'.
* Print the result.
