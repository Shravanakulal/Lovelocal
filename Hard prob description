You are given a string s. You can convert s to a 
palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aacecaaa"
Output: "aaacecaaa"

* Create the function 'short_p' that takes string 's' as input.
* Check if 's' is empty , if empty then there is no palindrome created.
* Modify the string s by appending the reverse of s to s by adding '#' in between.
* Compute the prefix array, this array helps find the length of the longest pallindromic prefix.
* Then the shortest palindrome is created by taking a substring of s from the length of the longest palindromic prefix to the end, reversing it, and then appending it to the original string s.
* Provide the input string.
* The result is stored in the variable 'output'.
* Print the output.
